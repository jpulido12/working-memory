    computes the loss for a batch of logits and inputs, limited to:
    - specific answer locations in the sequence
    - probabilistically chosen answer locations based on `sparsity`

    Parameters
    ----------
    - `logits` from a model (this can be softmaxed to get a distribution over the vocabulary elsewhere)
    - `inputs` is the dictionary of tensors supplied to the model, which includes the key `input_ids`
        and `answer_locations` which provides a 0-1 mask over which tokens in the sequence should be
        considered 'predictions' (only these are used for loss computation)
    - `sparsity` acts as an iid probability at each answer location to mask out the answer---this way, the model receives
       no loss at this location.
        Q: should we also mask the input answer immediately following the answer location?
    - `return_outputs` will cause the method to return the gathered logits, argmax-softmaxed logit answers, and true labels
        all as a dictionary with the keys `loss`, `gathered_logits`, `gathered_answers`, `gathered_labels`

    Example
    --------
    ```python
    outputs = compute_masked_loss(logits, inputs, return_outputs=True)
        loss, gathered_logits, gathered_answers, gathered_labels = (
